Sequence Diagram:
Details the flow of actions and interactions during gameplay:
1.	Player selects an action from the UI.
2.	Game processes the selected action.
3.	Game updates the player's status and triggers corresponding events.
 
c. Adopted Object-Oriented Design Pattern:
Singleton Pattern:
The Singleton pattern was employed to manage game constants and configurations efficiently.
Justification:
Centralizing game constants in a Singleton Constants class ensures consistency across components, simplifying maintenance and reducing redundancy. It also facilitates easier updates and modifications, enhancing scalability.
 2. Implementation Notes
 
a. Problem and Solution Table:
Problem	Solution
Database Connection Error	Implemented connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
UI Lagging	Utilized asynchronous tasks for UI rendering to improve responsiveness.
Inconsistent Battle Outcomes	Refactored battle logic in Battle.cpp to ensure consistent outcomes based on character attributes.
Essential Information:
•	Ensure correct integration of all code components to avoid runtime errors.
•	Incorporate necessary libraries such as Windows Forms for GUI development.
•	Define game constants and configurations in Constants.h to maintain centralized control and easy updates.
 3. Testing
 a. Test Cases:
1.	Room Visitation Test:
Objective: Validate that the room visitation status changes upon player's entry.
Procedure: Initialize a room, mark it as unvisited, enter with a player, and validate its visitation status change.
Outcome: The room status should transition from unvisited to visited.
2.	Music Toggle Test:
Objective: Confirm that background music starts/stops based on the checkbox state.
Procedure: Launch SettingsUI, check the default music state, toggle the checkbox, and monitor the music status.
Outcome: Background music should commence when the checkbox is checked and cease when unchecked.
3.	Character Health Test:
Objective: Ensure that player health updates correctly during battles.
Procedure: Simulate a battle scenario, monitor player health changes following monster attacks.
Outcome: Player health should decrement proportionally to the monster's attack strength.
